# STEP 0:
# define class first
# class Timer

# STEP 1:
# while initializing grab the elements in the page.
# e.g : stop button , start button and rest button .
# elements also may mean fields for showing time .
# constructor: ->
# #element = $('<JQUERY SELECTOR>')


# STEP 2:
# Defining bindings in the constructor with behaviourial methods
# e.g
# @element_1.on 'click', (event) -> behaviour_function



# STEP 3:
# Define the behaviourial methods
# This needs to be outside the constructor.
# e.g :
# behvaiour_function = ->
# do some thing here

# STEP 4:
# initialize an object in thedocument ready hook
# constructor would do all the bindings and our elements should behave properly.
